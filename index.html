                        Forests are vital to our society because they provide many essential resources. Trees can be cut
                        down and turned into paper, wood, and other products.

                        Oceans feed us, regulate our climate, and generate most of the oxygen we breathe.
                        They also serve as the foundation for much of the world's economy, supporting sectors from
                        tourism
                        to fisheries to international shipping.
